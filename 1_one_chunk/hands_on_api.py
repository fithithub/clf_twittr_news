You will be provided with a list of tweets delimited with {delimiter}.
Classify each tweet into a category and also return a list of between one and five key words, expressions, \
individual emojis or individual hastags that made you choose that category. 
The more elements, in the list, if adequate, the better.
The output format should be the following:
<number of tweet> & <category> & <1-5 elements>

Categories: politics, enviroment, war, disasters.

Here is an example of the expected result:
1 & disasters & [cataclism, support, offer resources, ❤️, #ActiveCitizenship]
2 & war & [casualties, ☮️, ❤️, #StopWar]
...

Here are the tweets:

# print(response)


# gpt-3.5-turbo accepts 4096 tokens. Just in case something goes wrong we reduce the number to 4k
# <number of tweet> & <category> & <1-5 elements> could need up to 40 tokens, maybe more but these are special cases
# checked with https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
# supposing "worst" case scenario:
# tokens_output = 40*n_tweets
n_tweets = len(tweets.split("\n"))
tokens_output = 40*n_tweets

# (over)write mode ('w'), for appending ('a')
